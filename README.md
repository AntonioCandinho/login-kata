## Introduction

This repository contains a web page that implements the following user story:

**As a user, I should be able to log in with my email and password into the platform. This log in
process will generate a session token which should be persisted into the application so I
donâ€™t have to type my credentials when opening the app again and again. Once the user is
logged in, we should show him a button to close the user session.**


## How to run?

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14 was used for the development of this project so it is the recommended Node version to use, Node versions greater and including 8 should also be able to run this project, though. 

For running the project you can do: 

``` sh
npm install
npm run server
```

This commands will start a development web server in the port *3000*, it will serve the static html and js files that make the web page and will also act as a mock authentication API that will allow log in with any credentials. Once the server is up and running you can access it in the following url: http://localhost:3000

*Note: Sometimes webpack will take a litte bit to compile so be sure you see a Compiled sucessfully message before trying to access the server*

## Test coverage

This web page aims to be fully test covered. For that theree different kinds of tests are used: 

**Unit tests** will test modules in isolation, they require no dependencies and they can be ran with:

``` sh
npm run test:unit
```

**Integration tests** will test modules integration with different components. They are more expensive in time to run and maintain than unit test and require a running development web server in the port 3000 (`npm run serve`). Run them with:

``` sh
npm run test:integration
```

**E2E tests** these are the most expensive and for that reason the less common, these tests will
test the page like and end user would, clicking, scrolling, writing, etc. They need a running dev server (`npm run serve`). The following command should run them:

``` sh
npm run test:e2e
```

[Jest](https://jestjs.io) is the test framework that supports all of them. With Jest, (Selenium)[https://www.selenium.dev/] powers the e2e tests.

Because of the heterogeneous nature of the test system there is tool that could give a complete coverage report of the system so none is used.


## Production build

Although the development web server could be a very useful tool for quick development and demo it is **not suitable for a production environment**. For that a production build can be done issuing: 

``` sh
npm run build
```

This command will generate some static files in the **dist** directory this files could be server with your prefered HTTP server.
